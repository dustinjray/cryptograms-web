# Harry Potter Cryptogram Game

This is a game about deciphering quotes from the Harry Potter novels that have been run through a letter-replacement algorithm. 

## Motivation

I downloaded a cryptogram deciphering app on my phone and the thought occurred to me that I would like to play such a game, but with only quotes from a specific source. Since I love the Harry Potter books, I decided to go with those.

## How to Play

You will be presented with a series of blanks with the encrypted quote underneath them. If you think you know which letter from the original quote corresponds to the letter under the blanks, follow these steps:

1. Use the on-screen keyboard, or your physical keyboard, press the key corresponding to the BOTTOM letter. All instances of this letter will be highlighted.

2. Press the key of the letter you think belongs in the CORRECT quote, and it will appear on top. 

3. Repeat until victory.

## Features

### Hints

If you get stuck, click the "hint" button. This will randomly fill in the correct answer to a letter that you have not already correctly guessed. This could be an empty letter, or one that you have guessed incorrectly.

### Clear

If you get yourself confused and need to clear the board, use this button. It will also remove all hints that you have been given.

### Next

If you want to skip the current puzzle, press this button.

### Go To

Opens a prompt, allowing you to enter the number of a puzzle and go directly to that specific puzzle. Allows you to keep playing when you come back, though mid-game progress will not be saved.
